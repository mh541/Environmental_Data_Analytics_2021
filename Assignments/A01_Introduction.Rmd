## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I took stats with R with Dr. Albright so I am fairly comfortable with R and some data analytics, but have no experience with Git.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I feel pretty confident in R, but I still know I have a lot to learn and I am looking forward to that!

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I am not too coding-intuitive, but it is something I want to work on personally, it just may take a little extra time and patience.


## 2) GitHub
